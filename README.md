<h1>Stone Paper Scissors Game</h1>

  <p>Stone Paper Scissors is an interactive game powered by Machine Learning and Computer Vision, where hand gestures are recognized and classified in real-time to play. No need for buttons or controllersâ€”just use your hand gestures to challenge the AI! The game leverages my custom-built Computer Vision module designed specifically for advanced gesture recognition, making the classic game more immersive and tech-driven.</p>
